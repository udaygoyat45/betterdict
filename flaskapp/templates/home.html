  <h1 class="display-4">About This</h1>
  <p class="lead">Hello this is Uday. I was inspired to make this app when I saw myself struggling to remember and using
    the words I have looked up before. After doing some research,
    I discovered that the reason is: when you google stuff it is saved in your passive memory. In order to bring those
    words to your active memory, you
    have to recall the words and try to to use them in your daily life. This app will help remember the words you search
    and remind those words starting on a daily-basis
    and then increasing the time when you see the word again. This app's only purpose is to remind you and keep track of
    the words you search, if you fail to pay attention
    to the reminders, you may not see the results you expected. I am always improving on this app and adding new
    features. I tried to make this website as minimalistic as possible. Also
    there are no ads or premium fees either. Have fun ðŸ˜Š

    <h1 class="display-4">How to Use?</h1>
    <p class="lead"> You can search words here anytime you want. Search any word to get it's defintion. In order to save
      the words, just sign up using your email adress.
      Once you have done that, simply search any word that you don't know the meaning of on this website. This app
      reminds on a continous basis to recall the word's meaning and using it in sentences. It's very simple and not time
      consuming!
